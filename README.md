# Tachyon: a JIT maths-optimized language

Tachyon is a just-in-time compiled programming language optimized for mathematical operations. It serves as a personal project, and includes a virtual machine, bytecode, high-level intermediate representation, and abstract syntax tree. It will employ various optimization techniques such as [tracing just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilation) to create fast and efficient programs during runtime.
